Subject: [PATCH] d/rules: also add --no-restart-after-upgrade parameter
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

is only a problem with dh compat >= 10 as that enables the
restart-after-upgrade by default.

Keep the old --no-restart-on-upgrade one as else debian may just
think we want the restart but as full stop in prerm and start only in
postinst.

For ceph we actually want to let the user fully control the restart
explicit.
